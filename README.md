# CS1 Listy String
Listy String project coded in pure C with no IDE for Computer Science 1

Objectives:
- Gain experience with file I/O and processing of command line arguments.
- Manipulate a linked list.
- Meet function requirements for each function.

Program Summary: Read in a supplied file, convert the supplied string into a linked list, manipulate the linked list dynamically based on passed through parameters.

Note: These programs from CS1 were critical in my development of C programming skills. I encourage the reader to open the PDF file supplied in this repositiory, or any other repository labeled CS1_, and to browse through the program requirements.
